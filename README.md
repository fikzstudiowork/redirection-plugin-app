Redirection Rules Match Plugin
Built by fikzdev

A powerful, all-in-one web application designed to automate the tedious process of creating 301 redirection rules for website migrations. This tool intelligently compares old and new sitemaps, generates smart redirection rules, and provides a complete user management system for a professional SaaS experience.

âœ¨ Features
Smart URL Matching: Instead of just finding exact matches, the tool uses a similarity algorithm to find the best possible new URL for an old one, minimizing 404 errors and preserving SEO value.

Customizable Threshold: A simple slider allows the admin to control how strict the "smart matching" algorithm is.

User & Admin Roles: A complete, two-tiered system:

Admin Access: A secure login for the administrator (fikzdev) with unlimited uses and access to a powerful management dashboard.

User Free Trial: A built-in free trial system for normal users (test / test123) with a 3-token limit.

Professional Admin Dashboard:

View real-time stats on user activity.

Visualize data with an activity graph.

Manage all users with Approve, Ban, Activate, and Refill Tokens actions.

One-Click Export: Generates a pre-formatted, 3-sheet Excel file (.xlsx) that is fully compatible with the popular "Redirection" WordPress plugin by John Godley.

Modern Interface: Built with a clean, responsive UI that is easy to use on any device.
